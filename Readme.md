Feed the Beast - Custom Ore Gen Settings
========================================

These are some Custom Ore Gen settings tailored for a Feed The Beast Mindcrack Server. Feel free to modify it as you see fit.
This was the result of some hand-tweaking of values and trying to find a decent balance for the ore generation. While generation is not anywhere near IC2 levels, Feed the Beast has other mods that help on that front. We also felt that for our server, we wanted a bit of a challenge and kept ore values artificially lower.

Current Features
----------------

Copper ore is generated at layers 40-70 and average 63 ore/chunk (Global average is around 30/chunk due to the layers and how much stone generates at that layer)

Tin ore is generated at layers 23-53 and average 77 ore/chunk (Global average is around 40/chunk)

Xycraft Xychromium is now MUCH less common and is generated as "sparse veins" -- if you were to remove all the stone, the veins look amazingly cool at night.

Xycraft Quartz is now MUCH less common and should be around 3 ore/chunk (note: if xycraft ends up using Quartz, COG allows the admin to repopulate the ore 'on the fly')

Xycraft aluminum now generates at layers 10-50 and at an avg 55 ore/chunk.

IC2 Uranium was toned down to an avg 10 ore/chunk.

Traincraft Crude Oil is set to a strategic cloud with hint veins, only occurring in swamp biomes.

Traincraft Sand Oil is set to sparse veins (similar to the xycraft ore) and will replace sand or sandstone.
